# Political Word Clouds

The topic I choose to scrap was politics. In todays news, lots of buzzwords are used in news headlines. I decided to make a word cloud for each main politcal party in the United States. I was curious to see the diffrence in words used to describe each party. The three parameters I used was "democratic party", "republican party", and "politics"
